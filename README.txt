This is my first web crawler. First, I will attempt to gain data from different website, then I will start a new private repository for my side projects.

The goal for this web crawler is as follow.
Have a basic UI for the web crawler: Enter zip code, provide directions to each restaurant. Perhaps use the other web app to provide this functionality.


Get the name of all of the restaurants 50 miles around a given zip code.
Save it all in my own personal SQL database with the following schema
Name of the restaurant.
Address of the restaurant
Links to their website
Menu
